###Great software doesn't just work, it makes life easier.
Hi, I’m Jon and I’m a full stack software developer.

I specialize in building responsive, intuitive web applications. I strive to deliver clean, maintainable, well-tested code.

If you’d like to see my technical chops, take a look at my resume. Or check out my blog or my github profile to see what I’ve been up to lately.

<!-- Not just for the end user,  -->
Every day we must ask ourselves: Are we solving a problem or creating more problems?



###The power of programming.
All it takes is an idea and an editor.
The power to change the world literally at our fingertips.
As always, we must use that power for good.
