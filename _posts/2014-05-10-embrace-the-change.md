So here we are, a brand new site and lots of exciting changes!

###Goodbye WordPress, hello Jekyll
WordPress is a fantastic tool, but I found it a bit too clunky for my needs. I'm looking for simplicity and productivity. Enter [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). With Jekyll, I get to blog with my favorite tools. Sure, the WordPress GUI is nice, but nothing beats the raw power of my editor and command line. Writing posts in Markdown and publishing with git? Sign me up.

###Breaking the corporate shackles
More excitingly, I've started a wonderful new job with the team at [Pomiet](http://www.pomiet.com/).
- Peace of Mind in Everyday Technology
- user experience focused
- cultivating a great culture of collaboration and creativity.

I can honestly say that the last few months have been the best of my career, and I get the feeling that the months to come will be even better.

###Goodbye MicroSoft, hello open source.
- Transition from C# and asp.NET to Ruby on Rails
- paradigm shift
