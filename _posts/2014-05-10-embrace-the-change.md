So here we are, a brand new site and lots of exciting changes! Scary, but if I've learned anything from [Agile](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/) and [Extreme Programming](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/), it's that change is something to be embraced. So let's get started!

### Goodbye WordPress, hello Jekyll
WordPress is a fantastic tool, but I found it a bit too clunky for my needs. I'm looking for simplicity and productivity. Enter [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). With Jekyll, I get to blog with my favorite tools. Sure, the WordPress GUI is nice, but nothing beats the raw power of my editor and command line. Writing posts in Markdown and publishing with git? Sign me up.

### Breaking the corporate shackles
More excitingly, I've started a wonderful new job with the team at [POMIET](http://www.pomiet.com/). Peace Of Mind In Everyday Technology. That's our goal, to  provide not only great user experiences, but great software development experiences as well.

The Pomiet team is actively cultivating a unique culture of collaboration and creativity. It's exciting to be part of a team with such smart and motivated people. I can honestly say that the last few months have been the best of my career, and I get the feeling that the best is yet to come.

### Trading in MicroSoft for Open Source
Along with the job change, I've also change technology stacks! I've spent the last few years as a Windows .NET developer, but always with an eye toward [open source](http://opensource.org/osd). At Pomiet, I've spent the last few months working with Ruby on Rails, and it's been a delightful experience. While I still think that C# is great language, it's been a joy to program in Ruby.

I admit, transitioning from a statically typed language to a dynamic one has been quite a paradigm shift, but it's been a great journey. This transition, along with the benefits and the drawbacks, are all things I hope to explore in future posts.

Until then, cheers!
