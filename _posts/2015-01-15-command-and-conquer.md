Recently I had the pleasure of giving a talk at the [Dayton Web Developers](http://www.meetup.com/dayton-web-developers/events/219096888/) user group. This is a great group, be sure to check it out!

The topic of discussion was the command line, as well as tips and tools to take your skills to the next level. I'll be updating this post to go over some of the things we discussed, but until then, feel free to take a look at my [dotfiles](https://github.com/jonoliver/dotfiles) on github. Also, if you're a fan of Simpsons gifs (you know you are), have a look at the [presentation slides](https://github.com/jonoliver/command-and-conquer). There are a lot of great resources in the readme file as well.

Thanks a lot to [@nrambeck](https://twitter.com/nrambeck) and [@AllenHMay](https://twitter.com/AllenHMay) for having me speak!
