<blockquote>The command line is powerful way to get things done, to automate things and to <strong>make your life as a developer easier</strong>.</blockquote>

Recently I had the pleasure of giving a talk at the [Dayton Web Developers](http://www.meetup.com/dayton-web-developers/events/219096888/) user group. Big thanks to [Nathan Rambeck](https://twitter.com/nrambeck) and [Allen May](https://twitter.com/AllenHMay) for organizing this awesome group and having me as a guest speaker. They meet monthly and cover a wide variety of topics. Be sure to check them out!

This month's topic of discussion was the [command line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface), and why it should be an essential part of every developer's workflow. I shared tips and tools to increase productivity and (hopefully) make life easier.

I'll be doing a series of posts to highlight some of the key discussion points. The first post is up, check it out!

After that, head on over to GitHub to take a look at the [presentation notes](https://github.com/jonoliver/command-and-conquer), and if you're a fan of Simpsons gifs (you know you are), have a look at the [slides](https://jonoliver.github.io/command-and-conquer/#/) as well.
